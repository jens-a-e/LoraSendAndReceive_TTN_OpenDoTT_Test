# Initial LoRaWAN Explorations for protoyping making wearable IoT

The experiences creating a[connection test for LoRaWAN](code/explorations/LoraSendAndReceive_TTN_OpenDoTT_Test) have shown that the limited transmission capabilities, particularly in frequency of messages of e.g. two per minute, impact the prototyping and playful exploration despite the promising low energy use and long range of the connection technology.

I have stopped the explorations due to several time impacting factors such as small but significant hardware issues on the Arduino MKR1310 WAN (battery polarity is opposite of standard wiring, charging capability not working) and repeated connection problems with local The Things Network infrastructure. The aim was to have a small and easy to creatively sketch with protoype board which can be powered with a small rechargeable battery and connects not only at home but throughout the local area of a participant.
